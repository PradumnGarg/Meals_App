# Meals_App

Have been studying flutter and Dart for over 3 months now and have created multiple apps in the process. This is a meals app I created a month ago as a challenge for the course fulfillment.A user can view a particular variety of meal and upon tapping the dish can see the recipe and ingredients required for thr process.Even can mark it as favourite and navigate to the favourite's screen to view the dish. By the use of drawers the user can also filter out meals based on certain preferences.

Haven't focuses much on UI cuz that wasn't the purpose and have passed data via constructors and not state management. Will continue to improvise my skills in the domain. 
Working on a major project with the prime goal of getting it out on the play Store. I hope everything goes well as planned!
